<h2> Project Description </h2>
<p>
  This project has two main goals:
</p>
<p> 1. Exploit deep learning to localize certain diseases by taking in MRI images </p>
<p> 2. Visualize the concept above by builing an web-based GUI </p>

<h2> Disease: Supraspinatus tendons Tearing </h2>

<p> [Schematic Image of Supraspinatus tendons MRI] </p>
<p> 
  Particularily, I will be examining MRI images of human shoulder. Moreover, from the MRI image, I will only 
  observe the Supraspinatus tendons region. It is one of the group of shoulder muscles/tendons that act to 
  stabilize the shoulder. If the patient suffers from supraspinatus tendons tearing, a white spot will appear
  in the MRI image.
